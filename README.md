# Ray-tracing

This repository contains the implementation of a ray tracing algorithm I developed with Francesco Zappa (who did most of the work). The code computes the trajectory of light rays using general relativistic geodesic equations. You can see what would happen if a black hole appeared in front of the Physics Department at the University of Parma.
